            <p>I have a passion for crafting smooth and user-friendly apps, specializing in both Android and web applications.</p>
            <p>My toolkit includes Jetpack Compose, React, and React Native for building seamless apps from the ground up.</p>
            <p>I aim for enhancing the user experience across phones, tablets, and browsers</p>
            <p>When I'm not working on code, I'm usually playing games, trying a new recipe (I'm a professionally trained cook), or touring the NYC food-scape.</p>
            <p>If you're interested in innovative app development or discussing the latest tech trends, I'd love to connect and explore new possibilities together.</p>
